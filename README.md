Rainy Alley is a cinematic environment project built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to explore and demonstrate my understanding of real-time rendering techniques. Set in a moody, rain-soaked alley, the scene showcases realistic materials, dynamic reflections, and advanced lighting to create an immersive atmosphere. The project emphasizes visual storytelling through the interaction of wet surfaces, illuminated details, and weather effectsâ€”highlighting how thoughtful environment design and material work contribute to realism and mood in a real-time engine.
